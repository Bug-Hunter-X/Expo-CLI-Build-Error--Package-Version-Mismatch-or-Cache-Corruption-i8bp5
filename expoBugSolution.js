The solution involves a multi-step approach:

1. **Check `package.json`:** Ensure that the `expo` package version in your `package.json` is compatible with your Expo CLI version.  You might need to update it using `npm install expo@latest` or `yarn add expo@latest`.
2. **Clear the Expo cache:** Run `expo start --clear` in your project directory to clear the Expo cache. This can often resolve issues stemming from corrupted cached files.
3. **Update Expo CLI:** Check for and install the latest version of the Expo CLI using `npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn global add expo-cli`.
4. **Verify project setup:** Double-check that your project's configuration files (e.g., `app.json`, `app.config.js`) are correct and that all necessary dependencies are properly installed and linked.
5. **Check for conflicting dependencies:** Ensure you don't have conflicting versions of dependencies. Examine the `package-lock.json` (npm) or `yarn.lock` (yarn) files to identify and resolve any discrepancies. 
6. **Reinstall Node Modules:** As a last resort, you can try reinstalling your node modules with `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` or `rm -rf node_modules && yarn install` to fix potential inconsistencies in the dependencies.
