This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the Expo CLI version and the project's dependencies, specifically the `expo` package version in your `package.json` file.  It can also happen due to corrupted cache or incorrect project setup.  The error message might not be very descriptive, sometimes just mentioning issues with package resolution or build processes.
